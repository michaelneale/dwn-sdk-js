## Introduction

This repository contains a reference implementation of Decentralized Web Node (DWN) as per the [specification](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/). This specification is in a draft state and very much so a WIP. For the foreseeable future, a lot of the work on DWN will be split across this repo and the repo that houses the specification, which you can find [here](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-web-node). The current goal is to produce a [beta implementation](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-sdk-js/milestone/1) by Q4 2022. This won't include all interfaces described in the spec, but enough to begin building applications.

Proposals and issues for the specification itself should be submitted as pull requests to the [spec repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-web-node).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { Dwn } from '@tbd54566975/dwn-sdk-js';

// cool things
```

_Note: Works in both node and browser environments_
